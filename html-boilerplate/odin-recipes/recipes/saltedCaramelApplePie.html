    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the dough:</strong> Whisk the flour and salt, then work in the butter. Stir in the water. Transfer the dough to a work surface and knead until it's smooth. Divide the dough into two discs, wrap in storage wrap, and chill each half in plastic wrap.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the sauce:</strong> Heat the sugar until it's melted and amber in color. Add the butter, then add the cream. Remove from the heat and add the salt. Let cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the filling:</strong> Stir the filling ingredients until well-combined. Let it sit for about 30 minutes, then pour it through a strainer into a large bowl. Thicken the liquid on the stove. Allow the liquid to cool to room temperature, then stir it into the apple mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll the dough:</strong> Turn each dough disc out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll them out into 12-inch circles.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the pie:</strong> Press one of the dough halves into a pie pan. Add the filling, then top with Â½ of the caramel sauce. Place the remaining dough circle over top and crimp the edge. Brush the top with a beaten egg, sprinkle with turbinado sugar, and cut slits into the dough with a sharp knife.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the pie:</strong> Place the pie on a baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees F until the top is light golden brown, then reduce the heat to 375 degrees and continue baking until the top is a deep golden brown. Serve with the remaining caramel sauce.</li>
